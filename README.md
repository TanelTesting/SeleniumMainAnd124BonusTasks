Hello! 
Detailed instructions to tasks are not shown here as the respndents know them already. 
At this point would like the tasks to be "not so visible" for everyone too. 

List of finishted tasks: 
Main task
Bonus task 1.  
Bonus task 2. <- is located inside the MainTaskk.java  
Bonus task 4.  

Yes, the Bonust task3. I was unfortunately unable to finish mainly due to unexpected stomach flue. I hope you are not too angry about it. I am expecting to finish the "Bonus task 3." it in the future anyway.
